Node that represents a segment of the snake body. 
This is due to the limitations of ll
1. We can only place a specific type of node in the ll
2. ll provides no convenient way to update the data in a list
    We could expose the internal structure of the list but 
    the underlying data and implementation of a data structure
    is meant to be private and exposing it is a critical sin.
    A linked list that had an iterator interface would remedy this issue
